# Themes Icons Pack

The idea is to gather all great icon themes and desktop themes that work on a **Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon** system but often also work on other systems.



#Two scripts to install all icons and themes

But **fair warning** your icon or theme selection manager will have a LOT of choices then.


	all-in-once-installation_deb_icons.sh

	all-in-once-installation_deb_themes.sh

is for linux mint, ubuntu, debian, elementary and all derivatives of debian using apt-get and other commands.


#One script to uninstall all the themes and icons

Uninstalling can be as important as installing, I made also a 

	uninstall-all-icons-and-themes.sh

that will uninstall all icons, themes and repositories.


# Note

Because ambiance and radiance themes 'pollute' our theme manager I have added a script to install/delete them selectively. 

	install-ambiance-and-radiance.be
	uninstall-ambiance-and-radiance.sh


As a rule of thumb I will install themes from github and other preferably in the home folder.

	Beware themes will be copied to ~/.themes

	Beware icons will be copied to ~/.icons

	Beware cursors will be copied to ~/.icons

If provided with a deb, tar.gz or a script the installation ends up (most likely) in 

	/usr/share/themes

	/usr/share/icons


Remove manually if you have already an older/adapted version.


It is up to you to activate them with your theme/icon manager.

# Sardi Extra

Sardi totals up to 54 Sardi variations including Sardi and Sardi Extra.

These are all runs of the colour changing scripts. All icon themes in Sardi with the name COLORA have scripts to change the colours the way YOU want.

16 million colours = 16 million choices

These icons are the result of perfecting the scripts.

https://github.com/erikdubois/Sardi-Extra


Run this script to install the latest version

	icons-sardi-extra-latest.sh




# Surfn
--------------------------------- 

This icon theme is based on an older one i.e. yltra flat also on github.

This is an exercise in changing the directories from scalable/... to 22x22/...

**Surfn** (old name Super Ultra Flat Numix Remix) will be updated not the Yltra Flat icon set.

Run this script to have them installed :

	icons-surfn-latest.sh

# ICONS THIRD PARTIES



# Numix circle icons

https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle


Numix is used as a fall-back icon theme for Sardi icon theme. So you should install it. Whenever an icon is not yet made in Sardi, it will use the icon of Numix if they have made it.

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/2je4qz2.jpg)  



# Evopop icons

https://github.com/solus-project/evopop-icon-theme

Since not all icons are available or we see an icon from Mint-Y icon theme, we take the SURFN icon theme as a fallback icon theme to fill in the gaps.
The following lines have been added to the script to change the inherits line in order to get the missing icons : 


		echo "################################################################" 
		echo "Renaming the content of the index.theme"
		sudo find /usr/share/icons/EvoPop -name "index.theme" -type f -exec sed -i 's/'Inherits=gnome,hicolor'/'Inherits=Surfn,gnome,hicolor'/g' {}  \;

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al 

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
